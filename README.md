# CreditScoreClassification

Goal:
- Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

Data:
- train.zip
- test.zip

Report:
- ReportCreditScoreClassification.pdf. In this file I explain the decisions taken and the keys of this ML project. I hope it's usefull for somebody. I recommend to read the report parallely with the code

Code:
- CreditScoreClassification.ipynb. This is the file that contains the chunks of code used to get the results. Be careful with the library versions if you want to run it locally. It contains all the functions needed during the script.
